# MonthlyRainFall-Estimator
This program creates a class that stores the total rainfall for each of 12 months into an array of doubles, and contains methods to return the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall, the month with the most and the least rain, the rainfall in any month. And then write an application to demonstrate the service class.
